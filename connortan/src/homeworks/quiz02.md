1. Consider the following code snippet.

```java
arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1]
```

Which operators does the code contain?

2. Consider the following code snippet.

```java
int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;
```

What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?

3. To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use?

4. Which operator is used to compare two values, = or == ?

5. Explain the following code sample: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;
